# Introduction to Bioinformatics

Project 1

The 1st Project involved exercises related to Bioinformatics theory, algorithms (such as Smith-Waterman, Needleman-Wunsch, BLAST, etc.), and practical applications. 
These exercises covered various fundamental concepts in Bioinformatics, aiming to deepen understanding and proficiency in the field.

Project 2

The 2nd Project required reading, summarizing, and presenting the key points from 4 selected articles related to a chosen subject in Bioinformatics (Applications of Neural Networks in Bioinformatics). 
Î•ach team member summarized and presented key points from 2 articles.
The goal was to analyze and convey essential information from the articles, enhancing comprehension and communication skills in Bioinformatics. 


Technologies Used

* Bioinformatics algorithms and tools
* Literature review and presentation skills

Team Composition

Both projects were completed in two-member teams, fostering collaboration and peer learning.
